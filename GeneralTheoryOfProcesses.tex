\chapter{The General Theory of Processes}

\section{The Debut Theorem}

In studying cadlag processes in this book we have made repeated use that hitting times of open and closed sets are usually optional times.  These facts were very easy to prove
and appear in Lemma \ref{HittingTimesContinuous}.   In the general theory of processes we don't want to require continuity properties but at the same time we want to have
optional times handy.  In this section we prove that given a filtration satisfying the usual conditions, hitting times of progressively measurable sets are optional times.  

\begin{thm}[The Debut Theorem]\label{DebutTheorem}Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{A}, P)$ be a probability space with a filtration $\mathcal{F}_t$ for $0 \leq t < \infty$ that satisfies the usual conditions.  Let $A \subset [0, \infty) \times \Omega$ be progressively measurable and define $\tau_A = \inf \lbrace t \geq 0 \mid (t, \omega) \in A \rbrace$ then $\tau_A$ is an $\mathcal{F}$-optional time.
\end{thm}

The proof of the theorem is a bit involved and requires a series of lemmas to which we turn our attention.
